## Project Description

### What?
 Save relevant information, quote, thoughts and thinking in form of a text.
 
 
### Why?

   - Access your quote from everywhere as long as you have an internet connection
   - Make your quote persistent, immutable, independent of a device, and decentralized,
   - which means that the storage network is not under the control of a centralized entity that may shut down
   - or restrict access to the devices where your quote is stored.
   - Make the quote author identifiable and at the same time respect privacy with pseudo-anonymity.
   - Make your quote resistant to censorship, nobody can filter your quote.

### How?
   - Using an existing blockchain network : e.g Ethereum on testnet Goerli 
   - Programing a smart contract to interact with the blockchain network and store the quote  
   - Contract [0x869eb73925b91e230c2e6b6541cffcca2eb35103](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x869eb73925b91e230c2e6b6541cffcca2eb35103/)
   - Programing a backend to interact with the smart contract and retrieve quotes.
   - Programing a frontend to display the quotes.
